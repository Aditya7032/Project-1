Project Overview The News Research Tool is an AI-powered Streamlit application designed to streamline information gathering. It allows users to perform custom Google searches, fetch real-time headlines via NewsAPI, and upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) for instant analysis. By leveraging a hybrid ranking system that combines BM25 and Cosine Similarity, the tool ensures that the most relevant search results and articles are prioritized. Users can also generate concise summaries of web content and uploaded files using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).

Technology & Setup Built with Streamlit for the frontend, the application utilizes a robust stack of NLP and machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn, rank_bm25, sumy, nltk, and sentence-transformers. Data handling and file parsing are managed by numpy, torch, PyPDF2, and python-docx. To run the application, you will need API keys for NewsAPI and Google Custom Search (including a Search Engine ID). These credentials should be added to the configuration section of the main Python script (app.py), preferably using environment variables for security.

Usage & License Once configured, simply execute the command streamlit run app.py to launch the interface. The tool offers three distinct modes: Google Search for querying the web with ranked results, Fetch News for browsing and filtering live headlines by category or date, and Upload Document for extracting and summarizing text from local files. Contributions to the project are welcome via Pull Requests.
